Fabric# project is a variant of Hyperledger Fabric 1.4, a permissioned blockchain platform from Hyperledger. 
Compared with the vanilla version, Fabric# supports fine-grained secure data provenance, sharding, use of
secure hardware, and a blockchain native storage engine called ForkBase, to boost system performance.
